# Conclusion

Wow, what a whirlwind tour we've had!  Hopefully, you've gained some confidence in writing command-line apps, and know the
features Methadone provides to make it a snap.

This is just the tip of the iceberg; [my book][clibook] covers the topic of command-line application development in Ruby in much
more detail.

There's also more to Methadone than we've been able to cover here; the Rubydoc is extensive and up-to-date, so spend a few
minutes bouncing around to see what else there is.  And, feel free to [log issues][issues] or submit pull requests on the
[Github page][methadone-github].
